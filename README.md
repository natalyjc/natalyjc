## Hi there, I'm Nataly ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ I recently worked as a Summer Research Intern awarded by NASA New Jersey Space Grant Consortium. My research focused on predicting hazardous near-Earth objects using Random Forest and class imbalance techniques to enhance space safety. My interests also involve using deep learning models to solve real-world problems.
